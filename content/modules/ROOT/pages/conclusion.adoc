= Workshop conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully completed the Introduction to Ansible Automation Platform Self-Service Automation Portal workshop.

== What you accomplished

Over the past two hours, you've built a complete self-service automation solution that enables non-automation experts across your organization to run automation safely and effectively.

**Module 1: Configure Ansible Automation Platform for Self-Service Portal**

You configured role-based access control across both Ansible Automation Platform and Self-Service Portal:

* Created three teams representing different IT domains (cloud, network, RHEL)
* Assigned granular permissions to job templates, inventories, and credentials
* Built RBAC policies in the Self-Service Portal with catalog and scaffolder permissions
* Implemented conditional access rules for advanced scenarios

**Module 2: User Persona Testing in Self-Service Automation Portal**

You validated your RBAC configuration by testing as three different user personas:

* Experienced the portal as a cloud administrator with access to AWS, Azure, and GCP automation
* Tested as a network administrator with access to network-specific job templates
* Validated the RHEL administrator experience with Linux automation and select cloud provisioning capabilities

**Module 3: Surveys and Custom Templates**

You enhanced the self-service experience with dynamic content:

* Modified job template surveys in AAP and observed automatic synchronization to the portal
* Imported a custom dynamic template from a Git repository
* Launched sophisticated automation with advanced options beyond standard surveys

== Learning outcomes

By completing this workshop, you should now understand:

* **How RBAC works across AAP and Self-Service Portal** - The relationship between users, teams, organizations, and permissions in both systems, and how to implement least-privilege access control
* **How to configure team-based automation access** - Creating teams and assigning granular permissions to job templates, inventories, and credentials for different IT domains
* **How to build permission policies in the Self-Service Portal** - Using the Red Hat Developer Hub permissions framework to control catalog and scaffolder access
* **How to create conditional RBAC rules** - Implementing advanced access control scenarios with metadata-based conditions
* **How RBAC controls the user experience** - The way different users see only authorized automation based on team membership and permissions
* **The self-service portal user perspective** - How non-automation experts experience running automation without needing to understand Ansible or complex platform concepts
* **How synchronization works between AAP and the portal** - Organizations, users, teams, and job templates automatically sync, and how to trigger manual synchronization
* **How surveys enhance the user experience** - Interactive forms that prompt for input at job launch time, making automation more user-friendly
* **What custom dynamic templates are** - Git-backed templates that provide sophisticated, enterprise-ready automation experiences beyond what surveys can offer
* **How to import and use custom templates** - Loading templates from Git repositories and providing advanced options, conditional logic, and rich user interfaces

== Key takeaways

=== Technical skills gained

* **RBAC Configuration Expertise** - You now understand how to implement least-privilege access control across AAP and Self-Service Portal, ensuring users see only the automation they're authorized to execute

* **Synchronization Understanding** - You know how AAP content (organizations, users, teams, job templates) automatically syncs to the Self-Service Portal and how to trigger manual synchronization when needed

* **User Experience Customization** - You can enhance automation with surveys for simple input collection and custom dynamic templates for sophisticated enterprise experiences

* **Team-Based Permissions** - You understand how to organize users into teams and grant permissions based on IT domain expertise, not automation knowledge

=== Business value delivered

By implementing Self-Service Automation Portal, you've addressed critical organizational challenges:

* **Broadened Automation Adoption** - Subject matter experts can now run automation without becoming Ansible experts, increasing platform usage and ROI

* **Reduced Automation Team Burden** - Self-service capabilities mean fewer manual requests for the automation team, freeing them to build more valuable automation

* **Maintained Governance and Security** - RBAC ensures users can only access and execute automation appropriate to their role, maintaining compliance and security standards

* **Improved Time to Value** - Domain experts can trigger automation as part of their daily work, reducing delays and manual processes

* **Scalable Access Model** - The team-based permission structure scales as your organization grows, making it easy to onboard new users

== Architecture summary

Your Self-Service Automation Portal deployment consists of:

* **Ansible Automation Platform 2.6** - The automation control plane managing credentials, inventories, projects, and job templates
* **Self-Service Portal** - The user-facing application running on OpenShift, providing a simplified interface for automation execution
* **RBAC Integration** - Synchronized permissions between AAP and the portal ensuring consistent access control
* **Dynamic Content** - Job templates with surveys and custom templates from Git repositories for flexible user experiences

All of this is deployed on **Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform**, providing a secure, scalable, enterprise-ready foundation.

== Next steps

=== Immediate actions

**1. Plan Your Production Deployment**

Consider your organization's needs:

* How many teams and domains will use self-service automation?
* What job templates should be exposed through the portal?
* What governance and approval workflows are required?
* How will you organize teams and permissions?

**2. Identify Pilot Users**

Select a small group of subject matter experts to pilot the portal:

* Choose users from different domains (cloud, network, Linux, etc.)
* Include users with varying levels of automation experience
* Gather feedback on the user experience and automation needs

**3. Build Your Automation Library**

Expand the automation available through the portal:

* Identify common manual tasks that could be automated
* Create job templates with appropriate surveys for user input
* Develop custom dynamic templates for complex workflows
* Document automation use cases and expected outcomes

**4. Establish Governance**

Define policies for automation access:

* Who approves new automation being added to the portal?
* How are permissions reviewed and updated?
* What monitoring and auditing is required?
* How are incidents and issues handled?
