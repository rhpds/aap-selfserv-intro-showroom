= User Persona Testing in Self-Service Automation Portal

In the first part of this workshop, we configured Ansible Automation Platform for Self-Service Portal and configured RBAC in AAP 2.6 that will be used for Self-Service Portal.
In this part of the workshop, we will test the Self-Service Automation Portal with the different user personas we created in the previous section.

The 3 users personas we will test for are, a Cloud Administrator, a Network Administrator, and a RHEL Administrator, all with different experties, but with limited knowledge of automation and Ansible Automation Platform. They just need to be able to run automation jobs thare are relevant to their IT domains.

|===
|**User**|**Password**
|**clouduser1**|`{aap_admin_password}` (same as AAP admin password)
|**networkuser1**|`{aap_admin_password}` (same as AAP admin password)
|**rheluser1**|`{aap_admin_password}` (same as AAP admin password)
|===

NOTE: **FOR BEST RESULTS... When logging in and out of Ansible Automation Platform AND Self-Service portal as different users, PLEASE CLOSE AND RE-OPEN YOUR BROWSER IN PRIVATE MODE (New Incognito Window) to ensure you are logged in / logged out as the correct user.**

[#clouduser1]
== Test as user **clouduser1**

Log in to the link:{self_service_portal_url}[Self-Service Portal^] as `clouduser1` with password `{aap_admin_password}`. You should see the Cloud job templates.

Take a moment and run some of the cloud job templates to see the results. Notice the user can select / change things like credentials and inventories, as they were granted access to use the credentials and inventories.

[#networkuser1]
== Test as user **networkuser1**

Log in to the link:{self_service_portal_url}[Self-Service Portal^] as `networkuser1` with password `{aap_admin_password}`. You should see the Network job templates.

Take a moment and run some of the network job templates to see the results. Notice the user can select / change things like credentials and inventories, as they were granted access to use the credentials and inventories.

[#rheluser1]
== Test as user **rheluser1**

Log in to the link:{self_service_portal_url}[Self-Service Portal^] as `rheluser1` with password `{aap_admin_password}`. You should see the RHEL job templates.

Take a moment and run some of the RHEL job templates to see the results. Notice the user can select / change things like credentials and inventories, as they were granted access to use the credentials and inventories.

== Learning Outcomes

By completing this module, you should now understand:

* **How RBAC controls the user experience** - Different users see only the automation they're authorized to access based on team membership and permissions
* **The self-service portal user perspective** - How non-automation experts experience running automation without needing to understand Ansible or complex platform concepts
* **How permissions affect automation execution** - Users can select and modify resources (credentials, inventories) they have "use" permissions for, but cannot see resources outside their scope
* **The value of persona-based access control** - Domain experts (cloud, network, RHEL) can focus on their specific automation needs without being overwhelmed by unrelated templates
* **Validation of RBAC configuration** - Testing as different users confirms that your permission policies work as intended

You've successfully validated that each user persona sees only their authorized automation templates and can execute jobs with appropriate credentials and inventories. The RBAC configuration you created in Module 1 is working correctly. Let's move on to the next module where you will modify surveys in AAP and see the results in Self-Service Automation Portal, then import a custom dynamic template.
