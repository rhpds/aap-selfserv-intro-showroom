= User Persona Testing in Self-Service Automation Portal

In the first part of this workshop, we configured Ansible Automation Platform for Self-Service Portal and configured RBAC in AAP 2.6 that will be used for Self-Service Portal.
In this part of the workshop, we will test the Self-Service Automation Portal with the different user personas we created in the previous section.

The 3 users personas we will test for are, a Cloud Administrator, a Network Administrator, and a RHEL Administrator, all with different experties, but with limited knowledge of automation and Ansible Automation Platform. They just need to be able to run automation jobs thare are relevant to their IT domains.
