= User Persona Testing in Self-Service Automation Portal

In the first part of this workshop, we configured Ansible Automation Platform for Self-Service Portal and configured RBAC in AAP 2.6 that will be used for Self-Service Portal.
In this part of the workshop, we will test the Self-Service Automation Portal with the different user personas we created in the previous section.

The 3 users personas we will test for are, a Cloud Administrator, a Network Administrator, and a RHEL Administrator, all with different experties, but with limited knowledge of automation and Ansible Automation Platform. They just need to be able to run automation jobs thare are relevant to their IT domains.

|**User**|**Password**
|**clouduser1**|passowrd provided part of your lab environment (will be same as AAP password)
|**networkuser1**|passowrd provided part of your lab environment (will be same as AAP password)
|**rheluser1**|passowrd provided part of your lab environment (will be same as AAP password)

NOTE: **FOR BEST RESULTS... When logging in and out of Ansible Automation Platform AND Self-Service portal as different users, PLEASE CLOSE AND RE-OPEN YOUR BROWSER IN PRIVATE MODE (New Incognito Window) to ensure you are logged in / logged out as the correct user.**

[#clouduser1]
== Test as user **clouduser1**

Log in to the `Self-Service portal` as `clouduser1`. You should see the Cloud job templates.

Take a moment and run some of the cloud job templates to see the results. Notice the user can select / change things like credentials and inventories, as they were granted access to use the credentials and inventories.

[#networkuser1]
== Test as user **networkuser1**

Log in to the `Self-Service portal` as `networkuser1`. You should see the Network job templates.

[#rheluser1]
== Test as user **rheluser1**

Log in to the `Self-Service portal` as `rheluser1`. You should see the RHEL job templates.

Take a moment and run some of the RHEL job templates to see the results. Notice the user can select / change things like credentials and inventories, as they were granted access to use the credentials and inventories.

Let's move on to the next section where you will modify surveys in AAP, and see the results in Self-service automation portal.  Then later in the Self-Service Automation Portal import import a custom dynamic template.
