= User Persona Testing in Self-Service Automation Portal

In the first part of this workshop, we configured Ansible Automation Platform for Self-Service Portal and configured RBAC in AAP 2.6 that will be used for Self-Service Portal.
In this part of the workshop, we will test the Self-Service Automation Portal with the different user personas we created in the previous section.

The 3 users personas we will test for are, a Cloud Administrator, a Network Administrator, and a RHEL Administrator, all with different experties, but with limited knowledge of automation and Ansible Automation Platform. They just need to be able to run automation jobs thare are relevant to their IT domains.

Take a moment and run some of the cloud job templates to see the results. Notice the user can select / change things like credentials and inventories, as they were granted access to use the credentials and inventories.

[#rheluser1]
== Test as user **rheluser1**

Log in to the `Self-Service portal` as `rheluser1`. You should see the RHEL job templates but not the custom job template that will later be backed by a custom template imported directy from a Git repository.
