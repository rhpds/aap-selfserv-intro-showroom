== What you'll learn

In this hands-on workshop, you will enable self-service automation for teams across your organization using Red Hat's Self-Service Automation Portal. You'll configure role-based access control, test different user personas, and create custom automation templates—all without requiring users to become Ansible experts.

== The challenge

Your organization has invested in Ansible Automation Platform and built powerful automation, but adoption is slow. Subject matter experts in cloud, network, and Linux domains want to run automation as part of their daily work, but they don't want to learn Ansible or navigate complex interfaces.

**Self-Service Automation Portal** solves this by providing a simple, secure interface that maintains governance through RBAC while broadening who can use automation.
