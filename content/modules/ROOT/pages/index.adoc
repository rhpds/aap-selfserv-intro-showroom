== What you'll learn

In this hands-on workshop, you will learn how to enable self-service automation for teams across your organization using Red Hat's Self-Service Automation Portal. You'll configure role-based access control, test the user experience from multiple personas, and create custom automation templates.

By the end of this workshop, you will:

* Configure role-based access control (RBAC) in Ansible Automation Platform and Self-Service Portal
* Set up teams and permissions for different IT domains (cloud, network, Linux)
* Test the self-service experience from multiple user perspectives
* Modify job template surveys and see changes automatically synchronized
* Import and launch custom dynamic templates for advanced automation experiences

== Who this is for

This workshop is designed for:

* **Ansible Automation Platform administrators** managing platform governance and user access
* **DevOps engineers** enabling self-service capabilities across teams
* **Platform architects** designing automation adoption strategies
* **IT leaders** seeking to broaden automation usage without requiring everyone to become Ansible experts

== The challenge you're solving

As a platform administrator, you face a common challenge: your organization has invested in Ansible Automation Platform and built powerful automation, but adoption is slow. Subject matter experts in cloud, network, and Linux domains want to run automation as part of their daily work, but they don't want to learn Ansible or navigate complex interfaces.

You need a solution that:

* Provides a simple, secure self-service interface for non-automation experts
* Maintains proper governance through role-based access control
* Reduces the burden on your automation team
* Broadens who can use automation across the organization

That's exactly what Self-Service Automation Portal delivers.

== Prerequisites

Before starting this workshop, you should have:

* Basic familiarity with Ansible Automation Platform concepts (organizations, users, teams, job templates)
* Understanding of role-based access control (RBAC) principles
* A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge recommended)

== Workshop environment

Your workshop environment includes:

* **Ansible Automation Platform 2.6** - Pre-configured with users, inventories, credentials, and job templates
* **Self-Service Automation Portal** - Deployed and ready for configuration
* **Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform** - Hosting the applications (available for reference)

=== Your access information

* **Ansible Automation Platform**: {aap_controller_url}
* **Self-Service Portal**: {self_service_portal_url}
* **OpenShift Console**: {openshift_console_url}
* **Admin username**: `{aap_admin_username}`
* **Admin password**: `{aap_admin_password}`

[IMPORTANT]
