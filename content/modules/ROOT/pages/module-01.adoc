= Configure Ansible Automation Platform for Self Service Portal

== Environment background

In your environment you will have access to the following:

* `Ansible Automaiton Platform.` It is set up with users, inventories, credentials, a project, and a number of job templates, all of which will be used in this lab.

* `Self-service automation portal.` You will perform the setup in AAP, and in Self-service portal to enable different user personas to leverage automation.

* `OpenShift Container Platform.` You will have access but you will not need to use it.

NOTE: **FOR BEST RESULTS... When logging in and out of Ansible Automation Platform AND Self-Service portal as different users, PLEASE CLOSE AND RE-OPEN YOUR BROWSER IN PRIVATE MODE (New Incognito Window) to ensure you are logged in / logged out as the correct user.**

== Configuring RBAC in AAP 2.6 that will be used for Self Service portal

=== What is Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in AAP
Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) uses Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage user access to automation resources, ensuring governance, security, and compliance across an enterprise. RBAC is primarily configured within the Automation Controller, the platform's control plane and web UI. 

==== **Key Concepts of AAP RBAC**

RBAC in AAP operates on the principle of least privilege, meaning users are granted only the permissions necessary to perform their specific job functions. This is managed through a hierarchy of users, teams, and organizations, which are assigned specific roles and permissions to various automation objects. 

* **Users**: Individuals who log into the platform. They can be normal users, auditors (read-only access to all objects), or administrators (full system privileges).

* **Teams**: Logical groupings of users within an organization. Users inherit permissions from the teams they belong to.

* **Organizations**: Collections of users, teams, projects, and credentials, serving as a primary container for managing and delegating automation resources.

* **Roles and Permissions**: Define what a user or team can do with specific objects (e.g., read, write, or execute job templates, view inventories, manage credentials). 

=== Create 3 teams in AAP:

Log in to the link:{aap_controller_url}[Ansible Automation Platform^] with the `{aap_admin_username}` user and password `{aap_admin_password}`.

Expand the `Access Management` menu on the left.

`Access Management` -> `Teams` -> `+Create Team`.

* `cloud-team`
* `network-team`
* `rhel-team`

Create each team as follows and click `Create team` to save the team(s).

Now that you have created the teams, you will assign roles and users to the teams.

Starting with the `cloud-team`:
`Access Management` -> `Teams` -> `cloud-team` -> `Roles` -> `+Assign roles`

image::assignroles.png[Assign roles to the teams in Ansible Automation Platform]

. In the `Assign roles` step one, select `Job Template` as the resource type, and click `Next`.
. In step 2, select all the job templates that begin with `Cloud/AWS`, and click `Next`.
. In step 3, select the role to apply, please select `Job Template Execute`, and click `Next`.
. In step 4, review your work, and click `Finish`.

image::selectjobtemplates.png[Select job templates to assign to the team in Ansible Automation Platform]
image::finish1strole.png[Finish assigning roles to the team in Ansible Automation Platform]

Repeat the same process for assiging roles by adding the following roles:

`Access Management` -> `Teams` -> `cloud-team` -> `Roles` -> `+Assign roles` -> Resource Type: `Inventory`

For `Inventory`, select the follwoing 3 inventories and click `Next`.

* `AWS Inventory`
* `Azure Inventory`
* `GCP Inventory`

* `Next` -> select `Inventory Use` as the role to apply -> Review your work and click `Finish`

image::assigninventoryrole.png[Assign inventory use role to the cloud-team]

`Access Management` -> `Teams` -> `cloud-team` -> `Roles` -> `+Assign roles` -> Resource Type: `Credential`

For `Credential`, select the following 3 credentials and click `Next`.

* `AWS Credential`
* `Azure Credential`
* `RHEL - SSH Credentials`

* `Next` -> select `Credential Use` as the role to apply -> Review your work and click `Finish`

image::assigncredentialrole.png[Assign credential use role to the cloud-team]

While still on the `cloud-team` page, assign the following `Users` to the `cloud-team`:

* Click on the `Users` tab, and select `+Assign users` -> select the `clouduser1`, and click `Assign users`.

image::assignuserrole.png[Assign users to the cloud-team]

**Repeat the same process for role and user assignmens to the `network-team` and `rhel-team` teams.**

For `network-team`, assign the following:

* For Resource Type: `Job Template`, select all the job templates that begin with `Network/`, and click `Next`. Please select `Job Template Execute` as the role to apply -> Review your work and click `Finish`

* For Resource Type: `Inventory`, select the `Network Inventory` and click `Next`. Please select `Inventory Use` as the role to apply -> Review your work and click `Finish`

* For Resource Type: `Credential`, select the `Network Credential` and click `Next`. Please select `Credential Use` as the role to apply -> Review your work and click `Finish`

While still on the `network-team` page, assign the following `Users` to the `network-team`:

* Click on the `Users` tab, and select `+Assign users` -> select the `networkuser1`, and click `Assign users`.

For `rhel-team`, assign the following:

* For Resource Type: `Job Template`, select all the job templates that begin with `Linux/RHEL`, AND add 2 other job templates named `Cloud/AWS Create RHEL10 instance` **AND** `Cloud/AWS Create RHEL9 instance` **AND** `RHEL / Update RHEL Time Servers` and click `Next`. Please select `Job Template Execute` as the role to apply -> Review your work and click `Finish`

* For Resource Type: `Inventory`, select the `RHEL Inventory` AND the `AWS Inventory` and click `Next`. Please select `Inventory Use` as the role to apply -> Review your work and click `Finish`

* For Resource Type: `Credential`, select the `AWS Credential` AND `RHEL - SSH Credentials` and click `Next`. Please select `Credential Use` as the role to apply -> Review your work and click `Finish`

While still on the `rhel-team` page, assign the following `Users` to the `rhel-team`:

* Click on the `Users` tab, and select `+Assign users` -> select the `rheluser1`, and click `Assign users`.

Awesome! You have now configured RBAC in Ansible Automation Platform.

[#validate]
== Validate content synchronization to Self Service portal

Now that you have configured RBAC in Ansible Automation Platform, you will configure RBAC in Self Service portal.
At this point if you log in to the Self Service portal as any of the users you created, you will NOT be able to see any job templates - yet.  But as an administrator you will be able to see all the job templates.

What you need to do is configure RBAC in Self-Service portal to allow the Portal users to see the automation templates they are authorized to execute.  Let's get to this next

[#ssprbac]
== Configuring RBAC in the Self-Service Automation Portal

=== What is Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Self-Service Automation Portal

Self-Service Automation Portal uses Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage user authorizations and permissions within the portal. It is built on top of the Red Hat Developer Hub Permissions framework and uses an administrator role to control who can perform actions and access specific resources.

==== **Supported Permissions**

* **The RBAC system defines permissions across different functional areas:** 

* **Catalog Permissions:** **Control actions related to the software catalog**, such as catalog.entity.read, catalog.entity.create, catalog.entity.delete, and more...

* **Scaffolder Permissions:** **Manage access to software templates and actions**, such as scaffolder.action.execute and scaffolder.template.parameter.read and more...

* **RBAC Permissions:** **Delegate administrative tasks** with policies like policy.entity.create, policy.entity.update, and policy.entity.delete. (The cloud / network / rhel team users will NOT need this permission.)

=== Log in to the `Self-Service portal` as `{aap_admin_username}`

Log in to the link:{self_service_portal_url}[Self-Service Portal^] with the `{aap_admin_username}` user and password `{aap_admin_password}`. When asked to `Authorize Self Service Portal?` click `Authorize`. Again, notice that the administrator user can see ALL the job templates. This automatically synchronizes to the Self Service portal on a regular configurable interval. 

At any time as an administrator you can use the `Sync now` button to synchronize Organizations, Users, Teams, and Job Templates from Ansible Automation Platform to the Self Service portal.

image::ssapadmin.png[Self Service portal administrator user can see all the job templates]

=== Configure RBAC in the Self Service Automation Portal

Now let's configure RBAC in the Self Service Automation Portal to allow the Portal users to see the automation templates they are authorized to execute.

Log in to the link:{self_service_portal_url}[Self-Service Portal^] with the `{aap_admin_username}` user and password `{aap_admin_password}`. You need to create a new RBAC role to allow the Portal users to see the automation templates they are authorized to execute. We will create 2 RBAC roles, `ssa-portal-users` and `saa-portal-rhel-team`

image::ssaprbac.png[Self Service portal administrator RBAC policy]

==== Create the `ssa-portal-users` role.
. In the bottom left corner expand the `Administration` menu and Click on `RBAC`, then click on `Create`.
. For the `Name` field, enter `ssa-portal-users`.
. For the `Description` field, enter `Role for Cloud and Network teams`, and click on `Next`.
. For the `Add users and groups` field, from the dropdown select `cloud-team` and `network-team`, scroll down and click on `Next`.
. For the `Add permistion policies` field, from the `Select plugins` dropdown select `Catalog` and `Scaffolder`.
. Just below expand the `Catalog` plugin and select the `catalog.entity.read` permission.
. Just below expand the `Scaffolder` plugin and select **ALL** the permissions **but NOT** `scaffolder.template.management` permission.
. Scroll down and click on `Next`.
. Review your work, and click on `Create` to save the role.

image::ssa-portal-users-role.png[Self Service portal administrator RBAC role for Cloud and Network teams]

==== Create the `saa-portal-rhel-team` role.
. In the bottom left corner expand the `Administration` menu and Click on `RBAC`, then click on `Create`.
. For the `Name` field, enter `saa-portal-rhel-team`.
. For the `Description` field, enter `Role for RHEL team`, and click on `Next`.
. For the `Add users and groups` field, from the dropdown select `rhel-team`, scroll down and click on `Next`.
. For the `Add permistion policies` field, from the `Select plugins` dropdown select `Catalog` and `Scaffolder`.
.. Just below expand the `Catalog` plugin and select the `catalog.entity.read` permission. At the very end of that row, click the 2 checkmarks in the `Actions` column to add a condition **at the very end of the row**.
.. In the `Condition` field, select `Not`, The `Add rule` option will be selected automatically.
.. In the `Rule` dropdown, select `HAS_METADATA`.
.. In the `key` field, enter `tags`.
.. In the `Value` field, enter `custom`, and click on `Save`.
.. You should see the condition added to the row with a green checkmark at the end.

. Just below expand the `Scaffolder` plugin and select **ALL** the permissions **but NOT** `scaffolder.template.management` permission.
. Scroll down and click on `Next`.
. Review your work, and click on `Create` to save the role.
.. You added a condition to the RBAC role to allow the RHEL team to see the RHEL job templates but NOT the custom job template that will later be backed by a custom template imported directy from a Git repository. (more on this later)

== Learning Outcomes

By completing this module, you should now understand:

* **How RBAC works in Ansible Automation Platform 2.6** - The relationship between users, teams, organizations, and permissions, and how to implement least-privilege access control
* **How to configure team-based access control** - Creating teams and assigning specific roles to job templates, inventories, and credentials for different IT domains
* **How RBAC works in Self-Service Automation Portal** - The permissions framework built on Red Hat Developer Hub and how it controls catalog and scaffolder access
* **How to create permission policies in the portal** - Building roles for different user groups and applying conditional rules for advanced access scenarios
