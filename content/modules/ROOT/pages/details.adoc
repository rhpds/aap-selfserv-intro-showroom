== Environment Details

=== Ansible Automation Platform

Your AAP instance is pre-configured with:

* **Organizations**: Default organization structure
* **Users**: Admin user plus team users (clouduser1, networkuser1, rheluser1)
* **Inventories**: AWS, Azure, GCP, Network, RHEL inventories
* **Credentials**: Cloud credentials, network credentials, SSH credentials
* **Projects**: Pre-synced automation projects
* **Job Templates**: Cloud, Network, and RHEL automation templates ready to use

=== Self-Service Automation Portal

Your Self-Service Portal instance is deployed on OpenShift and connected to your AAP instance. It synchronizes:

* Organizations
* Users and teams
* Job templates

Synchronization happens automatically at regular intervals, and administrators can trigger manual sync as needed.

=== OpenShift Container Platform

Your OpenShift cluster hosts:

* **AAP namespace**: `{aap_namespace}` - Ansible Automation Platform deployment
* **Self-Service Portal namespace**: Contains the portal and its components

You have access to the OpenShift console but won't need to interact with it directly in this workshop.

== Important Notes

=== Browser Best Practices

[IMPORTANT]
====
**For best results when logging in and out of Ansible Automation Platform AND Self-Service Portal as different users:**

* **Close and re-open your browser in private mode (incognito window)** between user sessions
* This ensures you're properly logged in/logged out as the correct user
* This prevents browser session conflicts
====
