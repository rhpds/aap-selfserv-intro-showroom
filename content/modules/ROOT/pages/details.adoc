== Technical Requirements

This workshop requires access to the following components:

* **Ansible Automation Platform 2.6** - Pre-configured with users, inventories, credentials, projects, and job templates
* **Self-Service Automation Portal** - Deployed and ready for configuration
* **Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform** - Available for reference (not actively used in exercises)

All components are pre-deployed in your workshop environment. You will receive access credentials and URLs to each system.

== Module Breakdown

=== Module 1: Configure Ansible Automation Platform for Self-Service Portal

**Duration**: 35 minutes

**Topics covered**:

* Understanding RBAC in Ansible Automation Platform 2.6
* Creating teams for different IT domains (cloud, network, RHEL)
* Assigning roles and permissions to job templates, inventories, and credentials
* Assigning users to teams
* Understanding RBAC in Self-Service Automation Portal
* Configuring portal permissions for catalog and scaffolder plugins
* Creating conditional RBAC rules for advanced access control
* Validating content synchronization between AAP and Self-Service Portal

**What you'll build**:

* 3 teams: `cloud-team`, `network-team`, `rhel-team`
* Role assignments for each team to specific job templates, inventories, and credentials
* 2 RBAC policies in Self-Service Portal: `ssa-portal-users` and `saa-portal-rhel-team`

=== Module 2: User Persona Testing in Self-Service Automation Portal

**Duration**: 30 minutes

**Topics covered**:

* Testing the portal as different user personas
* Validating that users only see authorized automation templates
* Understanding the user experience for non-automation experts
* Running automation jobs from the Self-Service Portal
* Observing how RBAC controls access to credentials and inventories

**User personas**:

* **Cloud Administrator** (`clouduser1`) - Access to AWS, Azure, GCP job templates
* **Network Administrator** (`networkuser1`) - Access to network automation templates
* **RHEL Administrator** (`rheluser1`) - Access to Linux/RHEL and select cloud provisioning templates

=== Module 3: Surveys and Custom Templates

**Duration**: 40 minutes

**Topics covered**:

* Understanding surveys in Ansible Automation Platform
* Modifying surveys on job templates in AAP
* Automatic synchronization of survey changes to Self-Service Portal
* Importing custom dynamic templates from Git repositories
* Advanced automation experiences with custom templates
* Launching and using custom dynamic templates

**What you'll build**:

* Enhanced survey on `Linux/RHEL START Service on RHEL` job template
* Custom dynamic template: `⏰ Manage RHEL Time Servers`

== Environment Details

=== Ansible Automation Platform

Your AAP instance is pre-configured with:

* **Organizations**: Default organization structure
* **Users**: Admin user plus team users (clouduser1, networkuser1, rheluser1)
* **Inventories**: AWS, Azure, GCP, Network, RHEL inventories
* **Credentials**: Cloud credentials, network credentials, SSH credentials
* **Projects**: Pre-synced automation projects
* **Job Templates**: Cloud, Network, and RHEL automation templates ready to use

=== Self-Service Automation Portal

Your Self-Service Portal instance is deployed on OpenShift and connected to your AAP instance. It synchronizes:

* Organizations
* Users and teams
* Job templates

Synchronization happens automatically at regular intervals, and administrators can trigger manual sync as needed.

=== OpenShift Container Platform

Your OpenShift cluster hosts:

* **AAP namespace**: `{aap_namespace}` - Ansible Automation Platform deployment
* **Self-Service Portal namespace**: Contains the portal and its components

You have access to the OpenShift console but won't need to interact with it directly in this workshop.

== Important Notes

=== Browser Best Practices

[IMPORTANT]
====
**For best results when logging in and out of Ansible Automation Platform AND Self-Service Portal as different users:**

* **Close and re-open your browser in private mode (incognito window)** between user sessions
* This ensures you're properly logged in/logged out as the correct user
* This prevents browser session conflicts
