= Surveys and Custom Templates

In the first part of this workshop, we configured Ansible Automation Platform for Self-Service Portal and configured RBAC in AAP 2.6 that will be used for Self-Service Portal.
In this part of the workshop, we will test the Self-Service Automation Portal with the different user personas we created in the previous section.

The 3 users personas we will test for are, a Cloud Administrator, a Network Administrator, and a RHEL Administrator, all with different experties, but with limited knowledge of automation and Ansible Automation Platform. They just need to be able to run automation jobs thare are relevant to their IT domains.

[#surveys]
== Modify surveys on some job templates. See the results in Self-Service portal (auto synchronization)

Log in to the `Self-Service portal` as `clouduser1`. You should see the Cloud job templates.

Take a moment and run some of the cloud job templates to see the results. Notice the user can select / change things like credentials and inventories, as they were granted access to use the credentials and inventories.

[#import]
== Import a custom dynamic template

Log in to the `Self-Service portal` as `networkuser1`. You should see the Network job templates.

Take a moment and run some of the network job templates to see the results. Notice the user can select / change things like credentials and inventories, as they were granted access to use the credentials and inventories.

[#configure]
== Configure the RBAC policy in Self service

Log in to the `Self-Service portal` as `rheluser1`. You should see the RHEL job templates.

Take a moment and run some of the RHEL job templates to see the results. Notice the user can select / change things like credentials and inventories, as they were granted access to use the credentials and inventories.

Let's move on to the next section where you will modify surveys in AAP, and see the results in Self-service automation portal.  Then later in the Self-Service Automation Portal import import a custom dynamic template.

[#launch]
== Launch the custom dynamic template
